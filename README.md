# Portfolio-App

This web app is designed to keep track of your investments in stocks and ETFs.
You must be registered to use the app. Once you are registered you can create your first portfolio and then you can start adding stocks or ETF 
shares to it. You will see a dashboard showing you the composition of your portfolio, showing the actual price of each stock, the percent change, and 
the total worth of your assets. Additionally, you can switch to another view where you can see all the transactions you have made.

This application has a decoupled architecture. The backend was made using Django Rest Framework and the frontend using Reactjs. 
The deployment set up uses a combination of uWSGI and Nginx.

The following features are going to be implemented in the future:
3) Migrate to PostgreSQL
4) Make the app 100 % responsive
